# "mandatory yet another hello world post"
I decided to start a blog in order to become a better writer, do more thorough research on topics that I find interesting
so I can write about them and get a better understanding of the topic at hand, and also help out other developers out there
with some useful tips.

This is the jist of what I want to write about in this blog, but in the end, what I'll be writing about might be completely different
than what I initially thought I'd be writing.

## why now, all of a sudden?
I realized I need to do something about my impostor syndrome and just do it. It helps nobody, not even myself, to not do things
because I think I'm not good enough, or that I need to be as good as [insert your famous programmer here] in order to start writing and
be taken seriously.

I could mention many examples of incompetent people who just go out and do things and, surprisingly, are very successful.

## how I plan on writing articles
I decided that I will write the articles as I go. At the time of this writing, I don't even have css on the blog. it's just plain html and browser defaults.
I believe content is what it's important right now.

Also, I'm beginning to get sick and tired of adding a bunch of dependencies for everything lately. That's why I chose Astro as my framework and I intend to continue
avoiding adding dependencies for as long as I can.

On a different opportunity, I plan on writing an article about how some dependencies are just fluff and why you should be very careful when following react tutorials online.
You might realize too late that, where the tutorial author used a dependency, they could've easily replaced it with just some good old HTML and string interpolation (I'M LOOKING AT YOU, feed.js).

## will I go back to using next.js?
I don't know. Maybe? Maybe not? I've started this project immediately by installing Astro, then I changed my mind and set up next.js instead, then changed my mind again, but this time
I setup astro on a different branch just in case and left the `main` alone for now. However, it's looking more and more like Astro is the way to go.

## what a huge pain it was to update a whole bunch of dependencies on a next.js project
## it's not safe to have a bunch of dependencies (I see you, left-pad!)
## one has to regularly update dependencies in order to avoid headaches (there! I'll call it what it is, a headache!)

I never thought my first article would be a rant about dependencies!


## motivation to write this blog
I'm writing this because of blablabla...

I want to [become a better version of myself, an MVP if you will](https://arendjr.nl/blog/2023/04/mvp-the-most-valuable-programmer/), and I believe that will be done, in part, by writing, getting better at writing as well.

as of now, the plan is to just use astro.js for as long as I can!
