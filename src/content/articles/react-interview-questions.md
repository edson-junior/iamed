# React Interview Questions

Inspired by Lucy Bain's series on javascript interview questions (https://lucybain.com/blog/tags/interview-questions/), I'm going to write a series of articles (with no particular order), about important interview questions. This will help me
get a better understanding of certain topics while helping others out there prepare for their interview as well.

the react interview questions' list is this one: https://github.com/sudheerj/reactjs-interview-questions, I will also create some articles on next.js interview questions just for good measure, here's the list: https://github.com/Devinterview-io/next-interview-questions

as you can see, there's a lot to unpack from that list. I'll probably not write an article about every single one of those, but I'll start from the ones I think are more critical during
inteviews.

since this is an open source project, if there's anything wrong in the posts, feel free to open up an issue, or fix it yourself.

hope this'll be fun for me and others! :)

**every post must include a TL;DR**
